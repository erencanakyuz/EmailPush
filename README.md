# EmailPush2 - Email Campaign Management System

A clean email campaign management API built with ASP.NET Core following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.

## üöÄ Features

- **Campaign CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update (PUT/PATCH), and delete email campaigns
- **Status Filtering**: Filter campaigns by status (Draft, Ready, Sending, Completed, Failed)
- **Email Validation**: Automatic email address validation
- **Email Sending**: Start email campaigns with background processing simulation
- **Statistics**: Track campaign performance and email delivery stats
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized layers with proper dependency direction
- **RESTful API**: Full REST compliance with proper HTTP verbs and status codes
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive Swagger documentation

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: REST controllers that handle HTTP requests
- **Application Layer**: MediatR handlers that implement business logic
- **Domain Layer**: Core entities, interfaces, and domain rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access implementation and external services

### Key Patterns

- **CQRS**: Command and Query separation using MediatR
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access
- **Dependency Injection**: Inversion of control using ASP.NET Core's built-in container
- **Middleware**: Global error handling and request logging

```
EmailPush.Api/             # Web API Layer (Presentation)
EmailPush.Application/     # Application Services & DTOs (Business Logic)
EmailPush.Domain/          # Domain Entities & Interfaces (Core)
EmailPush.Infrastructure/  # Data Access & Repositories (Infrastructure)
EmailPush.Worker/          # Background Service (Infrastructure)
```
## üîß Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0** - Web API Framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - Data Access with SQLite
- **MassTransit** - Message Queue (Optional)
- **Clean Architecture** - Domain-Driven Design
- **Generic Repository Pattern** - Data Access Pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - IoC Container
- **Swagger** - API Documentation


## üèõÔ∏è Software Development Principles Applied

### 1. Clean Architecture

**Layer Separation**: Each layer has specific responsibilities with minimized dependencies between layers.

**Dependency Direction**: Dependencies always point inward toward the Domain layer. Outer layers know about inner layers, but not vice versa.

|                                                             |
|   +-----------+      +------------+      +----------------+ |
|   |    API    |----->| Application|----->|     Domain     | |
|   +-----------+      +------------+      +----------------+ |
|                            ^                      ^         |
|                            |                      |         |
|   +-----------+      +----------------+           |         |
|   |  Worker   |----->| Infrastructure |-----------+         |
|   +-----------+      +----------------+                     |
|                                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Layer Responsibilities**:
- **EmailPush.Api** ‚Üí Presentation Layer (HTTP concerns)
- **EmailPush.Application** ‚Üí Application Layer (Business logic orchestration)
- **EmailPush.Domain** ‚Üí Domain Layer (Core business entities and rules)
- **EmailPush.Infrastructure** ‚Üí Infrastructure Layer (Data access, external services)

### 3. Dependency Injection

**IoC Container**: ASP.NET Core's built-in container manages object lifecycles and dependencies.

**Constructor Injection**: Dependencies (like IMediator) injected through constructors.

**Interface Abstractions**: Services depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations.

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD) // only for Learning intentions it wont use in project!1

**Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with NUnit.

**AAA Pattern**: Tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure for clarity.

### 5. SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has one reason to change (EmailValidator, CampaignMapper).

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes open for extension, closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes replaceable with base classes.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Focused, smaller interfaces rather than large monolithic ones.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

### Architecture Notes

*"Applied Clean Architecture principles with pragmatic Microsoft best practices. Domain core kept pure, dependency direction maintained, with practical approach in Program.cs DI setup and Worker background processing."*



## üìã API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/campaigns` | Get all campaigns |
| GET    | `/api/campaigns?status={status}` | Filter campaigns by status (0=Draft, 1=Ready, 2=Sending, 3=Completed, 4=Failed) |
| GET    | `/api/campaigns/{id}` | Get campaign by ID |

              ‚Üì
            Failed
```

## üìÑ Pagination Support

**Before**: All campaigns loaded at once, causing performance issues with large datasets

### Key Benefits:
- **Performance**: Only loads required records from database
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces server and client memory consumption  
- **Network Optimization**: Smaller payloads for faster API responses
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of campaigns without degradation
- **User Experience**: Smooth navigation through large result sets

### Usage:
```
GET /api/campaigns?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10
GET /api/campaigns?status=0&pageNumber=2&pageSize=5
```

**Default Settings**: 10 items per page, maximum 100 items, starts at page 1

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Key settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=EmailPush.db"
  }
}
```
